1. types.py:
    - Rewrite Nodes, Edges using dataclasses using BaseAttributed as base model (all methods must be in current controller for this model).
    - Create controllers for Attributed objects.
    - Controller must have logic for work with attributes in all models.(controller.attr['some_attr'].apply() or ect).
    - Delegate logic from Graph to <BaseAttributed>Controller

2. Base objects
    - Add nodes
        - type-checker as strategy creation.
        - chain of responce for creation.
    - Add add_edge method
    - Add add_edges method.
    - Add view by sample method.
    - Create more strategies of view graph.
    - (Optional) id, name or ect for Graph (if it'll be needed in view or spliting on subgraphs).

3. Optimise testing process.
