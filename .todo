1. types.py:
    1. Rewrite Nodes, Edges to MVC using BaseAttributed as base model (all methods must be in current controller for this model).
    2. Create controllers for Attributed objects.
    3. Controller must have logic for work with attributes in all models.(controller.attr['some_attr'].apply() or ect).
    4. Delegate logic from Graph to <BaseAttributed>Controller

2. Base objects:
    1. Add nodes
       1. type-checker as strategy creation.
       2. chain of responce for creation.
    2. Add add_edge method
    3. Add add_edges method.
    4. Add view by sample method.
    5. Create more strategies of view graph.
    6. (Optional) id, name or ect for Graph (if it'll be needed in view or spliting on subgraphs).

3. Testing:
   1. Complete test for <Edge> (unit)
   2. Add test for <Graph> (integration)
